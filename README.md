## Workshop: Simplifying data manipulation in R (90 min)

### Workshop objectives

* Introduce the concept of "tidy data" and demonstrate how data can easily be 
reshaped using package `tidyr`
* Show how data manipulation in R can be made more efficient using package 
`dplyr`

**NOTE** that in 90 mins we have barely time to scratch these topics, so the 
best possible outcome is that the participants are aware of them and can start 
exploring the topics and packages in more detail. 

### Description

For already a good while, R has been *the* go-to computational environment for 
any one us in need of statistical tools. While R does offer a dizzying variety
of analytic tools, much less effort has gone into simplifying the data 
wrangling parts that most of us actually spend the most of our time
struggling with. Luckily, things have gotten a lot better lately specifically
due to two packages: `tidyr` and `dplyr`.

[tidyr](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/07/22/introducing-tidyr/) is new package 
that makes it easy to "tidy" your data. Tidy data is data that's easy to work 
with: it's easy to munge (with `dplyr`), visualise (with `ggplot2` or `ggvis`) 
and model (with Râ€™s hundreds of modelling packages). The two most important 
properties of tidy data are:

* Each column is a variable.
* Each row is an observation.

[`dplyr`](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) 
package offers simple, clear and efficient way of working with your data. The 
package makes the most common data manipulation steps as fast and easy as 
possible by:

* Elucidating the most common data manipulation operations, so that your
  options are helpfully constrained when thinking about how to tackle a
  problem.
* Providing simple functions that correspond to the most common
  data manipulation verbs, so that you can easily translate your thoughts
  into code.
* Using efficient data storage backends, so that you spend as little time
  waiting for the computer as possible

### Prerequisites

A working knowledge in R is assumed. If you've written more than 10 lines of 
code then you can probably follow what's going on. We'll be running some example 
code (to be distributed in advance) in the workshop, so bring your own laptop.
Pairing up with someone with a laptop is also a good option. Make sure you have 
`R ` (>=3.1.0), `tidyr` (>=0.2.0) and `dplyr` (>=0.4.1) installed. **We will not 
have time to install these in the workshop! **[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) 
is *highly* recommended but not required.
